I'm a software engineer based in the Bay Area, California. Originally from Melbourne, Australia.

I currently [work](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commits?user=ikilpatrick) on Blink/Chromium focusing on CSS Layout.
I've touched/worked on almost all layout code within Blink including (but not limited to):
 - Anchor Positioning
 - Container Queries
 - Flexbox
 - Grid
 - Tables
 - Floats
 - Baselines
 - Flow layout
 - Replaced layout

Prior to Blink I worked as a Frontend Engineer on Google Docs/Drive.
